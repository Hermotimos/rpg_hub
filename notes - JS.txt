To follow best practices for building webpages dynamically with JavaScript, you should consider the following principles:

1.
Separation of Concerns: It's a good practice to separate your HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code.
Your HTML file should define the structure of your webpage,
your JavaScript should handle interactivity and dynamic content, and your CSS should define the styling.

2.
Use Templates: Instead of constructing HTML strings in your JavaScript as you've done in your code, consider using templates.
Templates help keep your HTML structure clean and make it easier to manage dynamic content.
You can use template engines like Handlebars, Mustache, or even ES6 template literals for this purpose.

3.
Event Delegation: Rather than adding event listeners to individual elements, use event delegation.
Attach event listeners to parent elements and use event delegation to handle events for dynamically created elements.

4.
Modularize Your Code: Break your JavaScript code into smaller, reusable functions and modules.
This makes your code more maintainable and easier to understand.

5.
Keep AJAX Calls Separate: Your code includes an AJAX call.
Consider separating your AJAX calls into a separate function or module.
This makes it easier to manage and test.

6.
Progressive Enhancement: Ensure that your page works even with JavaScript disabled.
Start with static HTML and progressively enhance it with JavaScript.

7.
Minimize Global Variables: Reduce the use of global variables.
Use functions and modules to encapsulate and isolate variables where needed.

8.
Optimize for Performance: Be mindful of performance considerations, especially when dealing with dynamic content.
Consider pagination or infinite scrolling if you expect a large amount of data.

9.
Error Handling: Implement error handling for AJAX requests.
This ensures graceful degradation in case of network issues or server errors.
