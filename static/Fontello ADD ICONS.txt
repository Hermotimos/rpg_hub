SCENARIO 1
If Fontello is accessed from the PC whose cookies it stores, than just add icons to those already chosen, (maybe customize their names),
and replace "font" directory and "fontello.css" file.

Place config.json inside "font" directory, as it may be usefull in the second scenario.



SCENARIO 2
If Fontello is accessed from a new machine, use Import feature (requires config.json file).
